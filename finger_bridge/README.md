### Laptop - Teensy communication standard

#### Data command from laptop to teensy
This command is used to send a position trajectory for the teensy to send to motors.

    <command_type = D> <data_length: int, 1-1000> <repeat = 1 | 0>

    <mcp_splay_position: float> <mcp_flex_position: float> <pip_flex_position: float>

    ...

    <mcp_splay_position: float> <mcp_flex_position: float> <pip_flex_position: float>
            
    <data_crc8: uint_8> 
    end

#### Go command from laptop to teensy
This command will start the teensy tracking the trajectory.

    <command_type = G>
    end


#### Stop command from laptop to teensy
This command will stop the teensy safely.

    <command_type = S>
    end

#### General feedback from teensy to laptop
The teensy is constantly sending these commands back to the laptop.

    <mcp_splay_position: float> <mcp_flex_position: float> <pip_flex_position: float> <active_bool: 1.0 | 0.0 >

#### Message recieved feedback from teensy to laptop
This message is response for a message recieved from the laptop.

    <success_bool >
